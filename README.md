Hello Developers,

I have started a journey through "Microservices Learning Series" â€“ an all-encompassing course tailored for developers keen on mastering the art of building scalable, efficient, and resilient Microservices using the .NET Core platform. This comprehensive guide covers a myriad of technologies, including Docker, Identity Server 4, Rabbit MQ , GRPC, SQL Server, MongoDB, PostGreSQL, Redis, Ocelot.

Key Highlights:

    Microservices Architecture: Delve into the design pattern where applications are structured as independent modules, fostering ease of development, testing, and deployment within well-defined boundaries.

    Hands-on Experience: Gain practical insights into Docker managing your Microservices effectively.

    Security Integration: Learn how to implement Identity Server 4 for robust authentication and authorization within your Microservices ecosystem.

    Messaging with Rabbit MQ: Explore messaging capabilities to facilitate seamless communication between Microservices.

    Efficient Communication: Harness the power of GRPC for efficient communication channels between Microservices. 

    Database Optimization: Configure and optimize SQL Server, MongoDB, PostGreSQL, and Redis databases to enhance Microservices performance.

    API Gateway Management: Utilize Ocelo to manage your Microservices API gateway.

and if you wanna test the project; first you should clone it to your pc, then you can run this command in
the project`s path :

<h6>docker-compose up -d --build</h6>
